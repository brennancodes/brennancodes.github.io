                <p>Hello there! My name is Brennan Spicer. I am a web developer hailing from the great state of Minnesota, raised in the even greater city of Eagan. I'm a 25 year old college graduate currently living with three longtime friends and our house mascot, Sawyer the border collie. In my free time I enjoy nerding out to all things Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, video games, and more. I also take pleasure in writing and playing inordinate amounts of subpar music! If I'm not at home or at work, you can find me studying in coffee shops, hiking around anything that slightly resembles wilderness, or enjoying a night out with my closest friends.</p>
                <p>If you're wondering how I got into web development, that makes two of us. My first exposure to web design was what Bob Ross would call a "happy accident." I was randomly invited to moderate a subreddit with no previous moderation experience. Over the coming days I would discover that this seemingly random invitation was part of a grand social experiment on Reddit, where hundreds upon hundreds of everyday users were invited to become moderators with full permissions. The entire subreddit devolved into obsolescence within a couple weeks (social experiment successful, I guess) but those first few days alone were the catalyst for my career trajectory. In the first day, other users were aggressively redesigning the CSS hour by hour if not minute by minute. Curiously, I watched the subreddit I was "moderating" take shape, change shape, and change shape again. I did some googling and did my first dive into the subreddit stylesheet. I tinkered with a couple lines of text that I had theories about, and tested my hypotheses. They worked. Slowly I became more and more ambitious until I realized I had already begun a fruitful love-hate relationship with CSS. The challenge, the frustration, and the incredible reward upon overcoming obstacles was wildly addicting. Years later, I succumbed to my love for web development and started on a path to change my career into that field. It's already been an invigorating journey, and somehow I get the sense that it's still only just beginning.</p>
