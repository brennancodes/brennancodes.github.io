# Password Generator

The Password Generator tool allows the user to select **Character Types** to dynamically formulate a **Random Password** between 8 and 128 characters. It also includes a **Copy Password to Clipboard** function to expedite the process of using and saving your new password.

## Character Types

Using checkboxes, the user can select any number of the following options:

- Lowercase Letters
- Uppercase Letters
- Special Characters
- Numbers

If the user neglects to select any options, the page will prompt them to select at least one before proceeding.

## Random Password

Along with the character types, the user will be prompted to select a desired password length. If the number entered is less than 8 or greater than 128, it will prompt the user to select a number between those values. Once the character types and desired password length between 8 and 128 is selected, clicking the "Generate Password" button will create a random password that meets the user's specifications.

## Copy Password to Clipboard

Once the password is generated, a second button will appear titled "Copy Password." Clicking the button will automatically copy the password text to the user's clipboard. The user is thusly enabled to paste it into whatever website they're registering for and/or into a private document or application for storage of all their passwords.
